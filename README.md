# Life Expectancy Calculator

The Life Expectancy Calculator generates a prediction of the userâ€™s total life expectancy using research from peer reviewed sources such as studies from the American Journal of Medicine, the Center for Disease Control, and more, as well as actuarial tables from the Social Security Administration. Inputs include income, BMI, education level, diabetes status (type 1 and 2), smoking habit, etc. to create a mortality curve with probabilities of death for each additional year of life. Our application assumes a conservative estimated death age when the probability of death within one year reaches 50%.
